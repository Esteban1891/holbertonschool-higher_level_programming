| Print a list of integers | Write a function that prints all integers of a list. |
| Secure access to an element in a list | Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C. |

## Advanced Tasks :light_rail:

| Files | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| CPython #0: Python lists | CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. Written in C, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the language. Since we now know a bit of C, we can look at what is happening under the hood of Python. Let’s have fun with Python and C, and let’s look at what makes Python so easy to use. |
